- Create a test for non-public SSH2 format.  We may have to roll our own.

- Implement SSH2 serialize.

- Test encrypted key files?

- Test DER format (PEM without the wrappers).

- File ticket with Net::SSH::Perl to use this.  This and a couple other
  changes can completely remove Math::Pari from its requirements.  I have
  done some simple testing that shows this works.

- Can we use the new key generation method if seed isn't given?

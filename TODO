- We're using NonBlocking=>1 currently.  Consider blocking or a way for the
  client to tell us.

- Finish going over documentation.

- Create a test for non-public SSH2 format

- Compare with CryptX, make an interop xt test

- Implement SSH2 serialize.

- makerandomrange -- see FIPS 186-4 appendix B for approved methods.
  - KeyChain/generate_keys is using B.1.2, assuming mrr is steps 4/5/6
  - GMP/sign is using B.2.2, assuming mrr is steps 4/5/6
  - mrr does the trick of getting 8-15 extra bits and looping until we fit
    inside a modulo boundary.  This gives us the no-bias behaviour of the
    x.2 method with the smaller entropy use of the x.1 method.  We need
    another poke through the logic.

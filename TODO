- Finish going over documentation.

- Create a test for non-public SSH2 format.  We may have to roll our own.

- Implement SSH2 serialize.

- makerandomrange -- see FIPS 186-4 appendix B for approved methods.
  - KeyChain/generate_keys is using B.1.2, assuming mrr is steps 4/5/6
  - GMP/sign is using B.2.2, assuming mrr is steps 4/5/6
  - mrr does the trick of getting 8-15 extra bits and looping until we fit
    inside a modulo boundary.  This gives us the no-bias behaviour of the
    x.2 method with the smaller entropy use of the x.1 method.  We need
    another poke through the logic.

- Make a CryptX Crypt::PK::DSA interop test.

- Test encrypted key files?

- Test DER format (PEM without the wrappers).

- File ticket with Net::SSH::Perl to use this.  This and a couple other
  changes can completely remove Math::Pari from its requirements.  I have
  done some simple testing that shows this works.

- Mention in documentation that everything is a BigInt.  This differs from
Crypt::OpenSSL::DSA where everything is a binary blob.

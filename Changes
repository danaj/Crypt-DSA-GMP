Revision history for Perl extension Crypt-DSA-GMP

0.01  2013-10-05

    Initial release.

    Ported from Crypt::DSA with complete rewrite of most of the internals.

    The following RTs were fixed:

      RT 13862 getting error                  [no longer using openssl]
      RT 14281 makerandom() not portable      [using Crypt::Random::Seed]
      RT 19263 which usage broken ...         [no longer using openssl]
      RT 19812 Warning in make test           [no longer using openssl]
      RT 21917 openssl not found if in ...    [no longer using openssl]
      RT 58094 3-arg open used                [we require 5.006]
      RT 19184 using of which in KeyChain...  [no longer using openssl]
      RT 49668 openssl dsaparam output ...    [no longer using openssl]
      RT 21968 /dev/random depletion ...      [using nonblocking]
      RT 71342 Patch to use Digest::SHA       [using Digest::SHA]
      RT 86424 typo fix                       [replaced with new typos]
      RT 18768 patch for MSWin32 support      [no longer using openssl]
      RT 88158 primality testing              [fixed]
      RT 88429 key generation issues          [fixed]
      RT 71421 Systems without /dev/random... [using Crypt::Random::Seed]
      RT 19477 $key->write not writing public [use Convert::PEM 0.07]

    The following RTs are still open:

      RT 26926 should Convert::PEM be a full dependency?
               Absolutely not until RT 27574 is fixed.

    The following RTs should be closed:

      RT 27144 Signature will croak during decode_base64.
               Perhaps old MIME::Base64?  This is not the current behavior.
      RT 54485 SSH2 format.  ssh-keygen writes a PEM file for private key.
      RT 72371 CPAN install missing Math::Pari.
               What in the world would cause this?  Nothing in this module.

    Note that 71421 and 21968 are somewhat conflicting.  This will be
    dealt with soon.
